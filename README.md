## Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you. My name is Tiago Antunes and I'm currently an Advanced Computing student @ Tsinghua University. In my repositories you can find many projects I have taken part in both during my studies and as side projects.

My main interests are Distributed Systems, GPU programming and Machine Learning and I'm looking forward to expand my knowledge in these areas. I'm currently starting my research in the high performance computing area.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:tiago.melo.antunes@gmail.com).

Fun fact: 我会说中文！ 😄
