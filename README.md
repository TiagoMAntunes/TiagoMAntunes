## Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you. My name is Tiago Antunes and I'm currently an Advanced Computing student @ Tsinghua University. In my repositories you can find many projects I have taken part in both during my studies and as side projects.

My main interests are Distributed Systems, GPU programming and Machine Learning and I'm looking forward to expand my knowledge in these areas. I'm currently starting my research in the high performance computing area.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:tiago.melo.antunes@gmail.com).

Fun fact: 我会说中文！ 😄

Some information about the pinned projects:
- `FastMoE` is a Mixture-of-Expert PyTorch implementation with CUDA backend, and includes optimizations presents in a paper I worked on.
- `AIOps2020` is a real-time system for anomaly detection with Kafka
- `OG` is a compiler developed for learning during my major.
- `graph_csr` is a parallel graph analytics crates written in Rust, with a focus on performance
- `go_kv` is a simple KV server with a backend and CLI for a quick display of knowledge in writing web APIs in Golang
- `Distributed-Systems-Mini-Projects` is my solution to the MIT 6.824 course, which includes developing a MapReduce and RAFT with a KV server all in golang, much more advanced than `go_kv`.
