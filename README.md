## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tiago, an engineer with a focus on performance analysis and parallelisation. My **specialty** is in developing high performing applications with CUDA acceleration.

I took my master's degree at **Tsinghua University** and I have worked on accelerating both Deep Learning and Big Data workloads.

I'm currently looking forward to continue expand my knowledge of **C++** as well as start diving more into **Rust**. I'm proficient in many other areas.

Check the pinned projects for some of my most interesting works :) Thanks!
