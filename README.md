## Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you. My name is Tiago Antunes and I'm currently an Advanced Computing student @ Tsinghua University. In my repositories you can find many projects I have taken part in both during my studies and as side projects.

My main interests are Distributed Systems, GPU programming and Machine Learning and I'm looking forward to expand my knowledge in these areas. I'm currently starting my research in the high performance computing area.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:tiago.melo.antunes@gmail.com).

Fun fact: 我会说中文 😄 其实我的水平还不够所以我随时学习！

## Some of my best projects
1. [Software Engineering project in a group of 5 where we extended the functionalities of an already existing software](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/quizzes_tutor)
2. [Development of a Distributed System from scratch](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/sauron-distributed-system)
3. [Creation of a programming language compiler for learning purposes](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/og_compiler)
4. [Development of a Client-Server Architecture from scratch in C with sockets](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/StudentForum)
5. [Design of a high-end prototype to demonstrate a smartwatch concept](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/iGo)
6. [Extension of an already existing software to support multi-threading and multi-process paradigm](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/Parallel-Circuit-Solver)
7. [AIOps Anomaly Detection and Localization, Root Cause Analysis](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/AIOps-Challenge)

These are some of the projects that I find the most interesting but I have many more you can check out in the repositories tab!
