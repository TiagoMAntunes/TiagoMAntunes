## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you. My name is Tiago Antunes and I'm currently a Computer Engineering student. In my repositories you can find many projects I did during my bachelor degree and some others extra I did by myself even before starting to study.

My main interests are Distributed Systems and Artificial Intelligence and I'm looking forward to expand my knowledge in these areas.

Feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:tiago.melo.antunes@gmail.com). I'm also a **Medium Writer** so make sure to [check out my posts](https://medium.com/@tm.antunes).

Fun fact: æˆ‘ä¼šè¯´ä¸­æ–‡ ðŸ˜„

## Some of my best projects
1. [Software Engineering project in a group of 5 where we extended the functionalities of an already existing software](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/quizzes_tutor)
2. [Development of a Distributed System from scratch](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/sauron-distributed-system)
3. [Creation of a programming language compiler for learning purposes](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/og_compiler)
4. [Development of a Client-Server Architecture from scratch in C with sockets](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/StudentForum)
5. [Design of a high-end prototype to demonstrate a smartwatch concept](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/iGo)
6. [Extension of an already existing software to support multi-threading and multi-process paradigm](https://github.com/TiagoMAntunes/Parallel-Circuit-Solver)

These are some of the projects that I find the most interesting but I have many more you can check out!
