## Hi there üëã

Nice to meet you. My name is Tiago Antunes and I'm currently an Advanced Computing student @ Tsinghua University. In my repositories you can find many projects I have taken part in both during my studies and as side projects.

My main interests are Distributed Systems, GPU programming and Machine Learning and I'm looking forward to expand my knowledge in these areas. I'm currently starting my research in the high performance computing area.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:tiago.melo.antunes@gmail.com).

Some information about the pinned projects:
- FastMoE is a Mixture-of-Expert PyTorch implementation that allows models to scale up with sparse parameter training, removing the relationship between number of parameters and computational complexity
- KAREN is a PyTorch library focused on Hate Speec Detection. It presents an easy framework for implementing algorithms with minimal effort and allowing it to run with also easy to implement datasets. It takes into account the different types of meta-data available for each specific model and allows for an immediate comparison between them, thus solving the problems of bias and dataset incompatibility
- Quizzes_tutor is a project I developed during my Software Engineering course. We worked as a team of 5 people and we had to improve some functionalities on an already large codebase. The team was divided into smaller teams that worked together on stories and implemented the required tasks
- AIOps2020 is a solution for the AIOPS 2020 competition which consisted on detecting anomalies in time series data, in real-time. We implement different ML solutions and we argue why they don't work. We also present a final solution that allowed us to detect some of the anomalies.
- Distributed-Systems-Mini-Projects is my solution for the MIT 6.824 course, which includes a simple MapReduce, RAFT, RAFT K/V Server and a RAFT K/V Sharded Server with changing configuration, all implemented in GoLang
- OG is a compiler for my compilers course. It required developing its lexicon, grammar, semantic analysis and assembly code generation.
